## Description
- The `smh` project is an exercise to build my own custom shell using the Rust programming language.
- The name is subject to change, but it is worth nothing that other candidate names included `msh` short for `Muhannad Shell` but instead the development team (myself) settled for [`smh`](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=smh).

## To Do
- [x] Error Handling
- [ ] Use my custom implementation of the Unix commands `cat` / `pwd` / `ls` included in this repository

## Running Instructions
- Clone the `/smh` directory
- `cargo build`
- `cargo run`

## Resources
- [Build Your Own Shell](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/)
